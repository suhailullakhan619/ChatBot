This is a **responsive chatbot** built with **React** that uses an external chatbot library (`supersimpledev` Chatbot API) to process messages.  
The bot can handle three built‑in commands:

1. **Flip Coin** – returns `Heads` or `Tails`
2. **Today Date** – returns the current date in a human‑readable format
3. **Roll Dice** – returns a number from 1 to 6

The app works on all screen sizes and chat messages persist using **localStorage**.
